# Introduction to spaCy for NLP and Machine Learning

## Dependencies
spacy
scikit-learn
nltk

To get the above requirements (except spaCy), you can download and install the Python distribution called Anaconda (it contains a lot of commonly used scientific and generally useful Python packages):
https://www.continuum.io/downloads

To install spaCy:
```
pip install spacy
python -m spacy.en.download all
```

Make sure to run the above python command, this downloads the models that spaCy needs. For those on slow connections, beware the model is about 530MB.

Python 3 is recommended, although Python 2 should work as long as you convert the strings to unicode objects.

## Running the files

1. From the command line (cmd) or terminal navigate to where this readme and .ipynb file is.
2. execute "ipython notebook Intro_spaCy_NLP"
